# Task8
K-Means Clustering â€” Mall Customer Segmentation
ðŸ“Œ Objective

Perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering to segment mall customers based on their annual income and spending behavior.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

* Python

* Pandas â†’ Data handling

* Matplotlib â†’ Data visualization

* Scikit-learn â†’ K-Means clustering, evaluation metrics

ðŸ“Š Dataset

* Mall_Customers.csv

* Rows: 200

* Columns:

CustomerID â€” Unique customer ID

Gender â€” Male/Female

Age â€” Customer age in years

Annual Income (k$) â€” Annual income in $1000 units

Spending Score (1-100) â€” Score assigned based on spending habits

ðŸš€ Steps Followed

* Load Dataset
Used Pandas to read and inspect the data.

* Feature Selection
Selected Annual Income and Spending Score for clustering.

* Elbow Method
Determined optimal number of clusters (K) by plotting WCSS vs K.

* K-Means Clustering

* Applied K-Means with optimal K.

* Assigned cluster labels to each customer.

Visualization

* Plotted customer segments in 2D.

* Marked centroids with yellow stars.

Evaluation
Calculated Silhouette Score to assess clustering quality.

ðŸ“ˆ Results

* Optimal Clusters (K): Determined from Elbow Curve

* Silhouette Score: Closer to 1 indicates better clustering

* Customers grouped into distinct segments based on spending and income.

ðŸŽ¯ Insights

* Identifies high-income high-spending customers (premium segment).

* Detects budget-conscious customers.

* Helps target marketing strategies effectively.
